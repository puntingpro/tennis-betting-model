## üìà Overview

PuntingPro v2 is an automated trading bot designed to identify and execute value bets on the Betfair Tennis exchange. The system leverages historical match data, advanced feature engineering, and a machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict match outcomes and find profitable trading opportunities in real-time.

This project is built for automation, using the official Betfair Stream API via the flumine Python framework to process market data and place bets with high speed and efficiency.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data-Driven Predictions:** Uses a machine learning model trained on comprehensive historical tennis data to calculate match probabilities.
- **Automated Bet Execution:** Connects directly to the Betfair Exchange Stream API to monitor markets and place bets automatically without manual intervention.
- **Value Betting Logic:** Implements a core strategy to only place bets when the model's calculated odds are more favorable than the live market odds.
- **Robust CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrated with GitHub Actions for automated linting, type-checking, testing, and code coverage reporting to ensure code quality and stability.
- **Structured Project Layout:** Follows modern Python best practices with a `src` layout, virtual environments, and a clear, modular structure.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/puntingpro/P1v2.git
cd P1v2
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the project and all its dependencies in editable mode.
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
```env
BETFAIR_USERNAME="your_betfair_username"
BETFAIR_PASSWORD="your_betfair_password"
BETFAIR_APP_KEY="your_live_app_key_from_betfair"
```
Place your Betfair API certificates (`client-2048.key` and `client-2048.crt`) in a `certs/` directory at the project root.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Run the main pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will initialize the connection to the Betfair Stream API, start listening for market data, and place bets when value opportunities are identified.

## üìä Project Status

The project is currently in **active development**. The core CI/CD pipeline is stable, and the foundational model training scripts are in place.

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate Official Betfair Data: Refactor data processing scripts to use official Betfair Data Portal.
- Upgrade to Flumine: Rearchitect the core betting logic for real-time stream processing and bet execution.
- Expand Test Coverage: Write comprehensive tests for the new Flumine-based logic and data modules.
