New Project Architecture: A Hybrid Approach
Our previous file-based system was fragile because it forced us to merge two separate datasets (Betfair and Sackmann) just to get a single, clean record of a match.

By switching to the Betfair API, we can now separate our concerns. This leads to a much cleaner and more powerful two-stage process:

Stage 1: Offline Feature Engineering (Using Sackmann Data)
The Sackmann data is an incredibly rich and valuable resource for historical player statistics. We will continue to use it, but only for this specific purpose.

What We Do:

We will have a dedicated script (similar to the old build_player_features.py) that runs "offline" whenever we want to update our stats database.

This script will read the entire atp_matches_2024.csv file and pre-calculate all the historical stats we need for every player:

Rolling win percentages

Surface-specific win percentages

Head-to-Head (H2H) win/loss records against every other player.

The output of this script will be a single, clean file, for example player_stats.csv. This file will act as our historical feature library.

Advantage: This complex calculation is done only periodically, not every time the main pipeline runs. It's efficient and keeps our historical data separate from our live data.

Stage 2: Live Value-Finding Pipeline (Using Betfair API)
This is the main pipeline that you will run to find betting opportunities. It will now be much simpler and faster.

What It Does:

Fetch Live Data: The pipeline will call the Betfair API to get a list of current or upcoming tennis matches and their real-time odds.

Enrich with Stats: For each player in a live match, the pipeline will perform a simple lookup in our player_stats.csv file to retrieve their pre-calculated historical stats.

Predict: It will then feed this combined data (live odds + historical stats) into your predictive model to get a win probability.

Detect Value: It will compare the model's prediction to the live odds to identify value bets.

Get Results: After a match is finished, the pipeline can call the Betfair API again to get the official, settled result, which is used to track the model's performance.

Advantage: This process is extremely robust. It completely eliminates the need for data reconciliation. We no longer have to worry about mismatched player names or dates between Betfair and Sackmann, because the API is our single source of truth for all live match information and results.

New Purpose

Why It's Better

Sackmann Data

A historical library for building a rich database of player stats (H2H, win %, etc.).

We leverage its rich historical detail without the pain of merging it with live data.

Betfair API

The live source for finding matches, getting real-time odds, and retrieving official match results.

It's a single, reliable source of truth for all live market information, eliminating data reconciliation errors.

This hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds: the statistical depth of the Sackmann data and the reliability and simplicity of the Betfair API.
